                            <p>As a result the last couple of eps haven’t been super exciting for me, because they’ve
                                been more like settling into a familiar and comfortable routine.  We’re seeing character
                                growth here but it’s subtle (apart from Shouyou, arguably).  I mean, Tobio being an
                                asshole is nothing new – it’s kind of the foundation of his entire character arc. 
                                Confronting whether his being an asshole is a problem for the Crows this directly is a
                                bit of an evolution, and probably an overdue one at that, but the overall dynamic with
                            Kageyama is basically unchanged.</p>
